# Breast Cancer Prediction Using CART and Naive Bayes

## Project Summary
This project applies Naive Bayes and CART (Classification and Regression Trees) decision tree models for predicting breast cancer outcomes using the `breast-cancer.arff` dataset obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The project includes the application and evaluation of both models and visualization of the decision trees.

## How It Works

### Requirements
Before running the project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
The project uses the `breast-cancer.arff` file as its dataset, which should be present in the project's main directory.

### Execution
To run the project, execute the `main.py` script. You can run this script using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## Results
When you run the project, it trains and tests the Naive Bayes and CART decision tree models. It visualizes the confusion matrix and ROC curve for both models and generates a tree visualization for the CART decision tree model.
